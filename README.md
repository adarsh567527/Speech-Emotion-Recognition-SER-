# Speech-Emotion-Recognition-SER-
PROJECT OVERVIEW
Through all the available senses humans can actually sense the emotional state of their communication partner. The emotional detection is natural for humans but it is very difficult task for computers; although they can easily understand content based information, accessing the depth behind content is difficult and thatâ€™s what speech emotion recognition (SER) sets out to do. It is a system through which various audio speech files are classified into different emotions such as happy, sad, anger and neutral by computer. SER can be used in areas such as the medical field or customer call centers. With this project I hope to look into applying this model into an app that individuals with ASD can use when speaking to others to help guide conversation and create/maintain healthy relationships with others who have deficits in understanding others emotions
